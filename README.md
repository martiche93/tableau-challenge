## Analysis
1. Average Trips and Peak Hours for Genders
"Unknown" genders nearly double that of Male and Female CitiBike users. There are more "Customers" than "Subscribers", with "Unknown" gender users being the group with the longest averge trip durations.

2. User Analysis for Genders and Age
As expected, there is a decrease in trip rides with the colder season, but there is a slight increase for the "Unknown" gender from November to December. "Customer" tend to have longer drip rides that "Subscribers" do. The data can be unrealiable. There was a data point entry for the birth year of 1874, which is not possible for 2021.
